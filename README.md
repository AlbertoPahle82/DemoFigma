# WELCOME TO MY FIGMA DEMO APP

I created the project with create-react-app, then edited my package.json with the desired modules.
Is based with REDUX + REACT ROUTER because I wanted to think about A REAL production webapp and not just a demo (that i could develop as single page + state hooks)

## Images

Images are into the public/images folder to keep them separated form the code.

## Redux

I have set up an Action --> Service --> Reducer flow to keep all the data flow well organized.
You can find that into the src/http folder.

## Comments

You can find multiple comments to explain what's happening in the code! Have fun!

## Responsive layout and SCSS

You can find a responsive layout for mobile phones @media only screen and (max-width: 768px)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
